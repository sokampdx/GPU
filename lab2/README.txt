Lab for July 10, 2014

PLEASE WORK IN PAIRS OF TWO

Your mission is to add synchronization to an existing code that has none.

First, compile and run the file "shared_bitmap.cu"
This requires a few of the files found in common and lib, and possibly bin.

Look over the code, to understand what it is doing. 

Then think about where you need synchronization, and add it
(with __syncthreads()   )


Send one email per pair to karavan@pdx.edu with subject LAB2

Cut and paste any function you have modified into the email, or simply attach your .cu file to the email.
